      <h2>Gratitude, Creating and Getting Sh*t Done</h2>
      <p><i>10 June 2020 · Life</i></p>
      <div class="">
        <br>
        <p>June has finally rolled around after a few long months that are totally muddled together in my mind. In the midst of all the stress and anxiety brought by the pandemic I decided that June will be the month that I restart with my
          intention setting practice. </p>
        <br>
        <p>As the world reopens I’ve found myself reflecting on this “down time,” what it meant to me, and how I can move forward. Setting intentions is a practice that forces me to consider the past, present and future. To dive into my thoughts,
          reflect on my experiences, and choose what I want to carry with me into the future. My intentions for the month of June are the things I want to take with me me as I transition from “girl on the couch in pajamas” to “girl navigating
          post-quarantine confusion.”</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Channeling a Little Gratitude</h3>
        <br>
        <p>No one is grateful “by accident.” Gratitude requires conscious thought and reflection. Throughout these three months I prioritized appreciation. I prioritized being grateful. Despite being bummed about losing work, time, energy, and
          money. Pushing aside worry about the future, for myself, for those around me and for the rest of the world. Instead of wallowing in grief I encouraged myself to be grateful for what was right in front of me. </p>
        <br>
        <p>A short list of the things I found myself appreciating: the company of the people I was quarantined with, the ability to order necessities to my home, my ability to keep busy, the time I was able to use for experimenting in the kitchen,
          the phone calls and FaceTimes that kept me feeling close to my loved ones, experiencing what it’s like to foster (and adopt) a dog, the art I got to make.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Creation > Destruction</h3>
        <br>
        <p>When times get tough we tend to look for distractions. In the past few months I tried as best I could, as often as I could, to distract myself. From the stress and anxiety that comes with being inside all the time, from the stress and
          anxiety of being in the midst of a global pandemic. I challenged myself to be inventive, to be curious, to find solace in exploring the resources around me. I channeled my energy into being creative, into creating.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You can create art or music or a meal, but creation doesn’t always have to be tangible. You can create space for yourself to think, laugh, or reflect.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>See You Later Perfectionism</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Creating things isn’t always easy. I often have to remind myself that done is better than perfect. As someone who dabbles in perfectionism I look back to my high school and college self and laugh. I used to be the student to write and
          hand in a single draft without so much as giving it a second glance. Now, though, especially in times of stress, I find myself agonizing over whether I’m ready to publish something as banal an Instagram post. I find myself constantly
          fighting the urge to correct myself. To edit, revise, delete, or add something, anything. Perfectionism can be a nasty trait that leaves you constantly second guessing yourself.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Instead of giving in, I want to let go of that nagging worry that whatever I create is not good enough. Nothing is ever going to be good enough, period. But especially not if we don’t allow ourselves to make mistakes, learn more, and
          grow from them.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This month I will be grateful for the opportunity to create and remind myself that done is better than perfect. That messy is okay and there’s always room for improvement. That my personal best will continue to change and evolve.</p>
