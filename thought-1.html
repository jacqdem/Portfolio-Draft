      <h2>Stress Free Travel: The Essentials</h2>
      <p><i>20 April 2020 · Life</i></p>
      <div class="">
        <br>
        <p>I'm here to talk about my travel essentials. It feels like a strange moment to be talking about travel. Most of the world has been in lockdown for the past few months. I'm not sure how many people are packing up to go somewhere at the
          moment, but I know for some people (like me!) travel may be necessary right now. Let me do the thinking for you and hopefully make your packing and travel experience as stress free as possible. </p>
        <p>I generally try to keep my everyday essentials list pretty short and simple. My travel essentials, as a result, tend to be pretty similar. </p>
        <p>I'm going to go carry you through my thought thought process when it comes to packing and you'll find a travel essentials packing list at the bottom of this post.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Carry On </h3>
        <p>The first thing I think of when it comes to travel is what I need in my <strong>wallet</strong>. Some form of <strong>ID</strong>, usually my drivers license and passport. <strong>Keys</strong> to my house and to my car. <strong>Cash, debit card</strong>, and <strong>credit card</strong>, just to cover all the
          bases. In the US I rarely carry a debit card because credit cards are so widely accepted. In Europe it's the opposite. Although I still carry a credit card for emergencies, I find that a debit card is the way to go. In terms of cash, be
          sure to carry both the currency for departure and arrival destinations. Another note, it's usually much easier (and less expensive) to convert dollars to other currencies while you're still in the US. Just make sure you do it a few days in advance. </p>
        <p>Next is my <strong>phone, charger</strong> and <strong>headphones</strong>. Usually I won't take my laptop on a short trip, but if you decide to bring yours make sure to also have your charger. Regardless it's always useful to carry a <strong>converter</strong> with you. I never leave
          without my <strong>journal</strong> and favorite <strong>pen</strong>. And bring an extra pen just in case, it's not like they take up room. If I have time I'll pick up a <strong>magazine</strong>. If I have extra room I like to throw in a book, too. I like to keep any <strong>jewelry</strong> in my
          carryon. I try and stick with pieces like earrings and rings or chunky bracelets - anything that won't get tangled or stuck together. Life hack: bring a <strong>big scarf</strong>. It can double as a blanket in case you get cold on the plane and you will definitely use it on your trip - you can turn a scarf into almost anything you want it to be. My other must-haves are <strong>lip balm, hand lotion</strong>, and <strong>roll-on perfume</strong> to freshen up mid or post flight (even if it's more of a mental refresh than anything else). My advice is also to keep any <strong>medication</strong> easily accessible. Consider Tylenol, Advil, Tums, vitamins and any
          prescriptions! A <strong>reusable water bottle</strong> is also very convenient, especially if you have a long flight. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Toiletries</h3>
        <p>When it comes to toiletries it's pretty straight forward, and like with most other things, I like to keep it simple. I always bring a <strong>toothbrush, toothpaste, face wash</strong> and <strong>face lotion</strong>. I include some other products in my at home skincare
          routine, but unless it's a long trip I usually let myself off the hook. If it's a longer trip I may throw in my own <strong>body wash</strong> and <strong>body lotion</strong> as well. I'm pretty indiscriminate when it comes to hair products. if you want you can always
          bring your own shampoo, conditioner, gel or hairspray. You can check with wherever you're staying about other styling tools, most places will have a hair dryer available if that's one of your must haves. Other
          things that come in handy are a hair brush, tweezers, mini scissors, and nail clippers.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Beauty</h3>
        <p>My beauty routine is relatively low maintenance and I tend to stick with the same old, reliable products I like. I'll bring some <strong>tinted moisturizer, blush, liquid eyeliner, mascara</strong> and either a <strong>mini lipstick</strong> or <strong>tinted lip balm</strong>. Makeup
          doesn't take up much room but it can get heavy if you bring a lot of it. If you can't take your makeup off with regular face wash be sure to bring makeup remover.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Accessories</h3>
        <p>In terms of accessories I always bring a couple of <strong>scrunchies</strong> and <strong>hair clips</strong>. I hate when my hair is in my face, especially if I'm going somewhere warm. <strong>Sunglasses</strong> are a must regardless of climate. Other considerations, A belt that will go
          with your shoes. Speaking of shoes, at least one pair of comfortable shoes for walking. If you never wear them at home I can almost promise you won't wear them on vacation. Other considerations, sandals, a bathing suit, and a hat if you'll
          be in the sun or near the water. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Clothes</h3>
        <p>For clothes it can depend drastically on the length of the trip and where you're going. I like to stick with <strong>comfortable</strong> clothes that make me <strong>feel good</strong>. Try to focus on pieces that you can layer and dress up or down. </p>
